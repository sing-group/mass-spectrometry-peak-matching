# `Forward` peak matching algorithm ![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-MIT-brightgreen.svg "MIT License")
This repository contains an R implementation of the `Forward` peak matching algorithm implemented in Mass-Up (https://www.sing-group.org/mass-up/, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-015-0752-4)

The main function to apply the peak matching on a list of spectra is `binPeaks.forward` (the name is inspired by the `binPeaks` name used in [MALDIquant](https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant/)).

To quickly try it with sample data, just run the code in the `example.R` file.
